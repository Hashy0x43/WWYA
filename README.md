To explain a simple project simply, Weather Where You're At (WWYA) will show relevent weather information for where you are using:

- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), for building the site.

- [IP-API.com](ip-api.com) for Geolocation-from-IP Data

- <del>and the [NWS-API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) for, you guessed it, weather data!</del>
- Chose to use [OWM](https://openweathermap.org/) instead for the sake of simplicity.

###### Disclaimer: If you plan on trying this out, the services for Geolocation & Weather are free so naturally, there is a request/use limit. This project is meant for personal use and spending real life money to use paid services is out of the question right now.
